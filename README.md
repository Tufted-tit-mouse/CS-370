Work Done on the Project
Given Code: You likely received a pre-built environment for the TreasureMaze simulation, including predefined states, actions, and rewards.
Created Code: You built a neural network model to predict Q-values, implemented experience replay, and trained the agent using reinforcement learning techniques to optimize its path through the maze.
Connecting Learning to Computer Science
What Do Computer Scientists Do?
Computer scientists design algorithms, build software, and solve complex problems using logic and data-driven approaches. Your project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning—a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI)—to train an agent for pathfinding, which is similar to real-world applications like robotics, game AI, and autonomous navigation.

How Do Computer Scientists Approach Problems?
You applied the fundamental problem-solving approach:

Observe & Define the Problem – Understand the maze structure and reinforcement learning framework.
Plan a Solution – Implement an agent that balances exploration (discovery) and exploitation (optimization).
Iterate & Improve – Use experience replay, reward tuning, and policy refinement to make the agent more efficient.
Evaluate & Adjust – Analyze performance, tune hyperparameters, and reduce inefficiencies.
Ethical Responsibilities
To the End User:

Ensure that the AI system behaves predictably and fairly—e.g., avoiding bias in decision-making.
Avoid reinforcement learning models that may overfit or perform poorly in real-world scenarios.
Consider safety concerns—especially in AI applications like self-driving cars, where unpredictable behavior can be harmful.
To the Organization:

Develop efficient and scalable models that balance accuracy with computational cost.
Maintain transparency in how the model makes decisions—this is crucial for debugging and trust.
Uphold data privacy and security when handling user interactions, especially in AI-driven applications.
